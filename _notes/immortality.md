True immortality is impossible, everything will come to an end (see [The Timelapse of The Future]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA)))

I would like to achieve [[ammortality]] though. Although it is very important to know that the desire for immortality is inversely proportional through the amount of suffering one has been through. This makes sense. I've gone through little suffering.

Second order effects:
- The ultimate historian
	- Would require infinite memory or supreme knowledge mapping tools
- Political paradigms would be less likely to change now that we can't rely on death to filter out old/bad ideas
- Divide amongst distinct agegroups that have biological advantages
