_The act of sharing a story is powerful. So much so that it synchronizes the brain activity of the teller and the listener._

“Your brain responses while listening become coupled to my brain responses, and slowly they become more similar to my brain responses,” said [Uri Hasson](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/uri-hasson), a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Princeton University. 
This is called speaker-listener neural coupling

That’s why when we experience an emotionally-charged event or hear a story of the same nature, certain parts of our brain release excess dopamine, making it easier to remember something with [greater accuracy](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/39/40/7920.full.pdf).

It seems like the magnum opus of storytelling is thought manipulation (yes, I know this seems dangerous/evil, but can also be good).
